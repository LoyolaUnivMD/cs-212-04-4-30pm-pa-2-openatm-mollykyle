I think the most challenging thing I experienced was just trying to figure out what the problem was asking of me.
Originally I had this idea that the user was going to put their name and their user number, and we would have to
have an array of both numbers and names and somehow have to scan through that to see if the person existed. While
now that could be done as we learned multidimensional arrays before it was confusing. The other thing that I thought was
difficult was thinking about how to check if someone is in array and then how to see if an array is empty and then being
able to add the user into that array. I actually went to tutoring and this helped me a lot because they went over what null
if and gave me a chance to talk about how I think it should be done and then how that's implemented in code. It was
extremely helpful to build on a lab I already knew as not only did it cut down coding time, I could think less about
some of the more basic java information because I had already worked that out in the past. I think I am becoming more
comfortable with classes but also there is still some confusion in regard to how to call and name some things, my brain
has had a really hard time adjusting to java coding from python. Like I know what I want to do, or how you would code it,
however, being able to immediately understand how to correctly implement it in java code, with all the rules and specific
syntax I still find difficult. I feel much better about arrays now, I get how to loop through them and manipulate them
much more than a few weeks ago.
